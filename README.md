# A multichannel RX SDR

`hw/` contains the KiCad sources.  
`fw/` contains the Vivado 2020 project. It requires the [ADI hdl](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/hdl/tree/2021_r1) repo.  
`sw/` contains the Petalinux driver sources and an example DTSI.  

Consider this work in progress.  

On the host side, you'll need [my gr-iio blocks][https://github.com/hennichodernich/gr-iio).
